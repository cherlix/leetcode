Need to rewrite: 
313: original thought miss some values.
486: GOOD ANALYSIS! Please read.
363: TLE.
368: TLE.
172: Didn't resolve.
234: Optimal solution.
334: No clue without looking into discussion.
73:  first column and row as marker.
116: clean and simple optimial solution with O(1) space complexity.

Need to rewrite: (Don't use any data structure or algorithm, need aha moment)
11:  TLE for log(n^2), need log(n).

Need to check optimal solution:
318: too slow.
486: bottom up DP solution.
373: see if there is better solution.

Need to review:
475: see if there is any other way.
652: post/pre order can be used for detecting the tree structure, but in order is not.
136: use XOR.
169: Moore voting problem.
13:  Review the clean code.
242: Use array rather than map when the input range is small.
287: Review the discussion.

Need to debug:
321: need to debug to find the bug.

Need to discover:
94:  check next challenges for tree.
105: stack overflow when applying big array.
